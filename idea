hyperswarmRouter
 this is a node.js lib but could it be used to transport 2 users webcam video audio streams and screen sharing because it transports unit8array over streams? i know they are all front end and this is backend. im thinking electron

Yes! This is an excellent use case for hyperswarmRouter in an Electron app. The library already handles Uint8Array data transport through its peer connections and CBOR encoding, making it well-suited for streaming binary data like video/audio streams.

Here's how you could adapt it:

// In Electron renderer process
const router = await require('hyperswarmRouter')(network);

// For webcam stream
const broadcast = router.join('video-stream', async (videoChunk) => {
  // Handle incoming video chunks from peer
  displayVideo(new Uint8Array(videoChunk));
});

// Get user media stream
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
const videoTrack = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];

// Convert video frames to chunks and broadcast
const processor = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({ track: videoTrack });
for await (const frame of processor.readable) {
  const chunk = await frame.copyTo();
  await broadcast(chunk);
}

renderer.js
The key advantages for implementing this in Electron:

Direct access to Node.js APIs and hyperswarmRouter
Native access to webcam/screen capture APIs
P2P communication without a central server
Built-in binary data handling through the streams
You could create separate topics for video, audio, and screen sharing streams, allowing granular control over each media type. The existing peer connection handling would manage all the networking complexity for you.
